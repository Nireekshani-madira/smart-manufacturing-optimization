Abstract placeholder
Smart Manufacturing Process Optimization Project

This project focuses on predicting machine failures in a manufacturing environment using synthetic data. 
The main objective is to optimize production efficiency, reduce downtime, and enhance predictive maintenance.

Steps involved:
1. Data Preparation – Generating synthetic manufacturing data
2. Feature Engineering – Creating new features and scaling numeric data
3. Model Training – Training an XGBoost classifier to predict failures
4. Inference – Predicting failures on processed data
5. Evaluation – Measuring model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

The pipeline is modular, reproducible, and can be deployed to Azure ML for real-time monitoring.
